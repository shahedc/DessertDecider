Dessert Decider

An ASP.NET Core 2.0 web app with a Bot interface that uses Cognitive Services to detect food items and identify desserts from pictures you upload, to be stored in a SQL Azure database.

Let the bot decide if you've had too much dessert by auto-calculating "dessert points", and ask the bot whether you should have any more dessert items!
