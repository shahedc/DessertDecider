Dessert Decider

An ASP.NET Core 2.0 web app with a Bot interface that uses Cognitive Services to detect food items and identify desserts from pictures you upload, to be stored in a SQL Azure database.

Let the bot decide if you've had too much dessert by auto-calculating "dessert points", and ask the bot whether you should have any more dessert items! 

- Web/API: http://dessertweb.azurewebsites.net/
- Bot: http://dessertbot.azurewebsites.net/
- Cognitive Services (Vision API): http://aka.ms/TryVision
- Dessert sample pic: <a href="images/dessert.jpeg">Dessert</a>

Ask:
- "Should I eat dessert?"
- "How many points do I have?" or "show me points"
- "What is my max?"
